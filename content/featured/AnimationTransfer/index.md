Creating plausible animation from a real video is challenging without utilizing expensive motion capture setups and expert animators. Our method provides a frugal alternative to expensive capture setup by utilizing only a single depth sensor. Furthermore the animation task is simplified by automatically setting up the characterâ€™s skeleton and rigging weights and transferring the captured motion sequence to it.
